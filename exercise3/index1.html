		If you are worried about annoying other people and are seeking solutions to solve that problem, you have already won half the battle. All it takes is being self-aware and adjusting the way you interact with the people around you. Pay attention to the way you speak to people in person, through text, and online, and tweak any behavior that you are worried about. It is also important to respect the boundaries of others and give them the right amount of personal space.

					 <li>
					 	<p>Listen more and talk about yourself less. People are probably going to get annoyed if you make everything about you. If you have exciting news or something cool to share that adds to the conversation, you do not have to hold it in. But try to give other people a chance to contribute to and lead conversations.[1]</p>

							<ul>
								<li>Don't automatically resort to chattering about yourself when a conversation stalls. Instead, try asking other people questions about themselves and really listen to their answers.</li>
								<li>For example, you might say something like, "You've mentioned before that you like K-pop music. Do you have a favorite band?"</li>
								<li>You might say to a friend, "Tell me about your weekend—I'm dying to know how your date with Elliot went!"</li>
							</ul>
					 </li>

					<li>
						<p>
							Don't interrupt people when they're talking. It's easy to irritate someone if you interrupt them when they're in the middle of a sentence. Interrupting basically communicates to them that you have no interest in what they're saying, or that what you want to say is more important. Let people complete their sentences before contributing to the conversation.
						</p>



						<ul>
						
							<li>It can help to pause for a few seconds to make sure they're finished before you share your thoughts.</li>
							<li>No one appreciates being interrupted, but it can get you into real trouble if you habitually interrupt a teacher, boss, or other authority figure.</li>

						</ul>

					</li>

					<li>
						<p>
						Spend less time talking about negative stuff. It is totally normal to vent and share negative things sometimes, especially with close friends, but if every sentence out of your mouth is a complaint or negative, people may start to avoid you. Also, constant negative commentary at work or in other group situations tends to create a toxic environment for everyone. Try to look on the bright side and spread positivity instead of negativity![2]
						</p>

						<ul>
							<li>For example, instead of saying, "Ugh, they're serving that disgusting meatloaf in the cafeteria again today," you might say, "Good thing the cafeteria is serving pumpkin pie today. Delicious pie will help us all forget about that meatloaf!"</li>
						
						</ul>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>
						Avoid oversharing to prevent others from feeling uncomfortable. Sharing detailed information about your personal life can make others really uncomfortable, especially coworkers and acquaintances. Depending on what you're sharing, your friends might also get pretty annoyed! Avoid telling people intimate details about your love life or physical health unless you know them well.[3]
						</p>

							<ul>
								<li>
							For example, if your coworker asks you how your weekend went, you probably shouldn't respond with a monologue about your hemorrhoid flare up. Something like, "I was actually feeling pretty under the weather this weekend," will suffice.
								</li>

								<li>
							Don't describe every gory detail of the horror movie you watched last night while your best friend tries to eat her lunch.
								</li>
							</ul>
					</li>

					<li>
						Speak at a normal volume to communicate clearly and effectively. It's fine to raise your voice for effect while telling a story or to whisper in a quiet room, but people get really annoyed if you constantly speak at maximum volume or habitually mumble. Match the volume of your voice to those around you and try not to talk over them. If you tend to speak too softly or mumble, work on enunciating and projecting your voice.
					</li>

		<!--six starts-->		
					<div class ="image"> <img src="images/method1/6m1of4.jpg"></div>			
			
					<li>
						Don't repeat words or actions over and over. Doing this might seem cute or funny at first, but constantly repeating the same words or actions (such as making inappropriate sounds or repeating a phrase) is going to get on people's nerves. If a person asks you to stop doing what you're doing, listen to them! If you continue without stopping, you might lose a friend.[4]

						<ul>
							<li>Do not mimic other people or repeat their words back to them for no reason.</li>
							<li>Say something once unless they ask you to repeat it.</li>

						</ul>
					</li>

		<!--seven starts-->					
					<div class ="image"> <img src="images/method1/7m1of4.jpg"></div>
					<li>
						Pay attention to the tone of your voice and what it might convey. Even if your words are thoughtful and important, your tone of voice may indicate frustration, crankiness, or a condescending attitude. You may not even realize you are being cranky, but things like being tired or stressed can make you that way.

						<ul>
							<li>If you notice people around you reacting, take a moment to check your tone. Try to speak in a respectful tone and phrase things in a positive manner.</li>
							

						</ul>

					 <li>
					 	<p>Do not send more than 1 or 2 texts if you have not gotten a response. Sending text after text, especially when you have not even received a response to the first one, will get on the other person's nerves pretty fast. Give them time to respond. Blowing up your friend's phone might seem innocent enough—until you find out later that she was at a funeral and that's why she did not respond right away.</p>

							<ul>
								<li>Repeatedly texting a crush can ruin a romance before it even begins. If you've sent 2 texts and your crush did not answer either of them, they may be trying to tell you they are uninterested.</li>
							</ul>
					 </li>
					
					 
		<!--two starts-->	
					<div class ="image"> <img src="images/method2/2m2of4.jpg"></div>

					<li>
						<p>
							Avoid group texting unless there is a real reason to do it. Adding your circle of friends or multiple family members to a group text just to share unimportant information will definitely annoy them. Other group members then chime in and suddenly everyone is getting a constant stream of pointless notifications!
						</p>
							<ul>						
							<li>If you have something super brief to share that doesn't require a response, it might be okay occasionally, but otherwise, avoid group texting!</li>
						</ul>
					</li>

		<!--three starts-->			
					<div class ="image"> <img src="images/method2/3m2of4.jpg"></div>
					<li>
						<p>
						Keep your texts relatively brief. Habitually texting incredibly lengthy or detailed messages irritates others and they may stop reading your texts altogether. If you have something important to say, call them or ask to meet up with them! Keep your texts short, sweet, and to the point.[5]
						</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Writing text "novels" might be especially annoying for your crush or someone you went on 1 date with.</li>						
						</ul>
					</li>

		<!--four starts-->					
					<div class ="image"> <img src="images/method2/4m2of4.jpg"></div>
					<li>
						<p>
						Do not send out mass texts to fish for ideas or things to do. People really don't like it when you send out a mass text on a Friday night that says, "What's going on this weekend?" or "What are you up to tonight?" A mass text like, "So what movie should I watch tonight?" is also pretty annoying. Mass texts are always super obvious and they feel really impersonal.[6]
						</p>

							<ul>
								<li>
							If you do send out mass texts, you may notice that you get fewer and fewer responses over time.
								</li>
							</ul>
					</li>

		<!--five starts-->					
			
						<div class ="image"> <img src="images/method2/5m2of4.jpg"></div>
						<li>
						Avoid texting to inform someone that you just left them a voicemail. If you called your friend and it went to voicemail, just leave a voicemail! Don't follow up your voicemail with a text that says, "Check your voicemail" or "Hey, I'm trying to get in touch with you." If they did not answer your call, they probably are not going to answer your text. Give them time to respond.[7]

						<ul>
							<li>						
							It's okay to be eager to talk to someone! Just try not to overdo it.</li>
						</ul>

						</li>
					
				</ol>
