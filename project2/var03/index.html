    <h1>Undone</h1>

      They ignored the new boy, <br />
      snickering behind his back. <br /><br />
    </p>

    <p>
      In silence, I stayed safe <br /><br />
      MyLipsPressedTogether.<br /><br />
    </p>

    <p>
      Growing bolder, <br />
      they pierced him <br />
      with arrow-sharp <br />
      words. <br /><br />
    </p>

    <p>
      I pretended I hadn’t heard.<br /><br />
    </p>


    <p>
      They twisted his arms. <br />
      One word escaped his lips before they dragged him <br />
      out of sight, <br />
      out of earshot: <br />
      “Cowards!” <br /><br />
    </p>

    <p>
      I ran away.<br /><br />
    </p>

    <p>
     All the words. I didn't say <br /><br />
     haunt me every day.<br />
    </p>
