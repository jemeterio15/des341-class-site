    <h1>Undone</h1>

    <p>
      They ignored the <em>new</em> boy, <br />
      snickering behind his back. <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      In silence, I stayed safe <br />
      My Lips <em>Pressed</em> Together.<br />
    </p>

    <p>
      Growing <strong>bolder</strong>, <br />
      they pierced him <br />
      with arrow-sharp <br />
      words. <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      I pretended I hadnâ€™t heard.<br />
    </p>


    <p>
      They <em>twisted</em> his arms. <br />
      One word escaped his lips <br />
      before they dragged him <br />
      out of sight, out of earshot: <br />
      <strong>"Cowards!"</strong> <br /><br />
    </p>

    <p>
      I ran away.<br />
    </p>

    <p>
      All the words. I didn't say <br />
      <em>haunt</em> me every day.<br />
    </p>
